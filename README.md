>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Work-in-progress** - Firefli is currently in the process of updating this read me and creating our documentation for Firefli. We recommend you host for free with our online platform, however you can still self-host by following our <a href="https://docs.firefli.net">Documentation</a>. Expect bugs in this beta. We've tried our best to iron out everything we could find in Tovy and Orbit, but we expect there to be issues. Let us know by creating an issue, or if you're adventurous... patch it yourself and send in a PR.

>[!TIP]
> The best and easiest way to get started with Firefli is our cloud hosting solution. It's easy, secure, and superfast. See https://www.firefli.net to get started. The best part? It's **FREE**!

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Firefli is a modern, improved, and maintained fork of the open source staff management platform, Orbit. It allows Roblox groups to manage their group members in a more intuitive and powerful way, while still being simple to use. Firefli aims to continue the original Tovy and Orbit mission and maintain, improve, and introduce new features to Firefli. So far, we've fixed critical bugs that essentially bricked Tovy and Orbit, improved the UI, and introduced image support to the wall. We also created our own custom runtime and cloud hosting service to bring Firefli to the masses for free, in just a few clicks.

  <h2>Why consider</h2>
